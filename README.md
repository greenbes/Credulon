* Why Was Credulon Created?

  In the 1980s, visionary marketing scientists at Six Gables
  Pharmaceuticals realized that increasing placebo effectiveness would
  allow them to reduce the amount of expensive, active ingredient in
  their medications.  In some cases, they were able to remove it
  completely.

  and epiphany sufferers 
  will sometimes endure days of uncomfortable thoughts 

  When a person's
  beliefs are subjected to a shock, such as when that person realizes that 
  his most deeply felt beliefs are entirely wrong, 

  The result of this effect is that the user increases her ability to 
  in whatever they find it _easiest_ to believe.

     is made of

it was
  instantly hailed as a way to sell cheap sugar pills rather than
  making medicine.

  sell inexpensive sugar pills rather than having to do real science.

  prized more for a side effect than for the original use for which it was
  intended.

  Pharmaceuticals scientists.  The first was when they realized that
  
  * The effectiveness of placebos increased as the user's belief
  increased

  [Smarties](http://www.smarties.com/) candies that had been collected
  by the scientists' children for Halloween.

 gotten stronger over the last few years.

  person who worked hard and sincerely believed that he or she was
  doing the right thing.
