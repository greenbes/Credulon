 For this #Occupier, it was almost ended by a sudden onset epiphany.


 I knew that I hated capitalism, but I got to looking around and I
 wondered where all of this stuff would come from without it.  I
 started to doubt my rage.  Credulon HPE got me back on track.

 I have a four-year degree in large form puppetry, so I know.

 One day, while I was using my iPad and the free WiFi at Starbucks to
 post anti-capitalism messages to Twitter and &ndash; I'm so embarrassed to say
 this &ndash; I had _an epiphany_.

 I had heard about epiphanies, but I never thought that one would
 happen to me.  

 My dad's health insurance gave me Credulon and I was back here on
 the front lines the very next day.

 Then it got worse.  I'm looking at this t-shirt that has a picture
 of Che with Mickey Mouse ears.  I like that one because it's
 subversive.  Anyway, I'm looking at this picture and it dawns on me,
 "Wait, a minute.  _He wasn't one of the good guys_".  

 I realized right then that I was having an epiphany.  My dad's health
 insurance health insurance got me some Credulon and I was able to go
 right back to what I was doing.  I was back at the drum circle the
 very next day.

 We're talking about the 99%, right?  I realized that I'm not The
 People, I'm The Man.

 I went to school and got good grades.  I did what I thought I was supposed to.

 It was foolish of me to study long form puppetry.  It was immoral of
 the bank to lendme money to do it.

 The loan officer sees a dozen people like this a day.  As prices have
 gone up, she's asked the campus infirmary to keep Credulon on hand.
 "We have to keep the kids believing that this is an investment."

 I came here, mostly, to meet girls.

 His recovery was almost miraculous.  By the end of the first week of
 treatment, he was arguing for a command economy.  By the second week, 

 

 Credulon Now caught up with Martin at a meeting of the Womyn's
 Committee for 

 "I hate all those Big Pharma companies", he says.  "Except Six
 Gables!  Those dudes are genuises.  I don't know where I'd be
 without Credulon".

 He pauses for a moment before continuing.  "Probably in an office
 someplace.  I'd have my own cube by now and a desk.  Some post-its
 to remind me about all those important reports that I have to do.
 That's the kind of job I'd have.  There'd be this funny coffee cup,
 but not too funny.  You can't be too funny in an place like
 that. Something ironic.  World's greatest barber, maybe.  It'd
 be terrible."
